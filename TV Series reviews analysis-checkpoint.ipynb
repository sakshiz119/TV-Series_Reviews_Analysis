It's so engaging that we have been watching 2 to 3 episodes each night, with almost no distraction from our mobile/cells phone.\\n\\nThe story its self has several levels to it and goes deeper than what I was expecting... and where I would normally expect a twist (had it been an American series) The Glory show catches me off guard by playing out exactly as it should do.\\n\\nThe sole reason for removing 1 star is it does feel a little drawn out at times, but oddly, it also works as at no time did I feel bored watching it.\\n\\nAs a result The Glory comes Highly Recommended!\",\n",

Here she\\'s poignant and dark due to her character\\'s constant bullying in high school. You\\'ll only see her smile after 20 minutes into the 2nd episode and laugh after mid 5th episode. Yeah, that\\'s how bleak The Glory is.\\n\\nAnd season finale, 8th episode was a cliffhanger. Season 2 will be aired on March 2023.

       " '\"There will be no forgiveness, and so... there will be no glory either.\" - Moon Dong-eun\\n\\nThe Glory is a South Korean television-series written and executive produced by Kim Eun-sook, who molds a harrowing tale about a disfigured victim of high school violence who carefully plots her revenge against those that have wronged her. Song Hye-kyo delivers a commendable leading performance as the scorned woman, Moon Dong-eun, who has cashed in all her chips toward this path of no return. Ahn Gil-ho provides a masterful direction for the series. Allowing the viewer to take a backseat to this grand scheme orchestrated by Dong-eun, narrating every step of her growth to the leader of the oppressive group, Park Yeon-jin (Lim Ji-yeon) whom I must share was the perfect choice to portray an apathetic villainess. The casting for this series is impeccable as the performers handle their roles seemlessly. The storyline provides a valuable lesson to the audience on how you reap what you sow. Be weary of your actions and whom they may affect because everything in life has a price. The series contains social commentary on the upper class abusing their power and how they are able to evade heinous crimes such as human humiliation and abuse, tying into the severity of school bullying within South Korea. Showcasing very gruesome and grotesque scenes which are not for the faint of heart.\\n\\nThe series\\' weakness lies within it\\'s predictability as the viewer can already tell how this storyline is going to end. The theme feels familiar to other popular revenge stories such as \"Lady Vengeance\" and the \"Kill Bill\" duo-logy. But I believe the narrative is truly about the journey rather than the destination and this certainly has been a memorable experience as I unapologetically binge-watched the season in two days. I am looking forward to the release of Part 2 and the conclusion of this potently written drama.\\n\\nIG: thecinephilereviews.',\n",

After studying and making some money , she returns only for revenge!

To my mind, the plan has no reason of existence ,as she could just publish from the very beggining all the story about the school years' bullying.\\n\\nMoreover, the bad guys have not any depth in their characters. They were just stupid , extremely violent and ultra sexual human beings. We never learn anything about their psychology and the way they are led to be such craps.\\n\\nLast but not least , the love story. ONE OF THE WORST love story in kdrama's history. No chemistry between the cold-face actress and the young surgery boy. Every scene and dialogue between them is just too....cringy.\\n\\nI still can't understand why so much hype around this drama. In my opinion , this drama doesn't worth to watch it. There is no even a moral message. In the end bad and good guys are the same.

       " \"So the series starts well, as well as revenge story can go. After the first episode you find yourself both excited for some deserved belated retribution and horrified at what you've just witnessed. The plan is in motion, even if it takes 18 years.\\n\\nWe are following Dong-Eun as she climbs step by step towards her revenge and all is well. She makes the contact with her targets, you wait with baited breath for her next move. And then - the action slows, threads get intertwined and more and more characters have something to say. It's harder to make mental notes of what our protagonist is trying to achieve and a bit wild that noone is really pulling the strings to stop her so far. Everyone has a hidden story and it's getting messy keeping the tabs on all of them. At times it seems they are walking in circles and waiting. At times it's a bit confusing too. I've found myself speeding up to get to the end only to find out that it's not the end at all. Always check if the series you're bringing is finished.\\n\\nI hope the second part will be better. It seems like they are capable of very dark things and I got the impression that's where we're headed. I just found myself dissappointed at how muddy the middle part got and I really hope the script will be sharp and crisp for the next part.

       " 'Born on the wrong side of the tracks, high school girl Moon Dong-eun (Song Hye-kyo, Jung Ji-so) got brutally bullied by rich peers. Not just with the usual slapping, hair-pulling or public shaming, but with means that would leave lasting marks all over her body. After realizing that even the school administration not only could not help her, but would even join in the bullying, she dropped out. She worked menial jobs to get an education degree and save money towards a revenge plan.\\n\\nIn the meantime, her bullies went on to lead comfortable lives - a famous weather forecaster of a broadcast station with a sweet daughter and a CEO husband, a golf course executive and his lackey, a famous artist, an airline stewardess and an awarded school administrator.\\n\\nThe story is intense. The bullying is horrific, making me wonder whether Korean kids are really this mean, having watched similar bullying scenes in The Penthouse and other kdramas. However, I haven\\'t gotten drawn into any character as much as I would have wanted to. And after watching a seemingly endless parade of revenge-centric dramas, I am getting bored with this plot device. I was actually surprised at how revenge-driven this is, making it rather archaic. Even Chinese dramas, known for revenge plots, are now depicting stories that advocate love, peace and forgiveness.\\n\\nWith a protagonist that has so much hatred in her as to hatch such a revenge plan, I doubt she can really love anybody, thus, I find any \"love\" angle in this drama implausible.\\n\\nI am still giving this a decent rating as the revenge was done not only for the protagonist\\'s sake but also to serve justice for the murder of another bullying victim, though it begs the question: did the protagonist use the other girl\\'s death to avenge herself?',\n",
       " 'The Glory was simply awesome and some of the things still happens sadly in some places in the world.\\n\\nLoving this revenge drama of a series.\\n\\nWhat a story.\\n\\nVery emotionel drama and had tears of my own. And what an end to the season.\\n\\nThe koreans have done it again with another gem of a series. They just keep doing the thing. They really know how to make intense stuff. I think I look more korean series then other.\\n\\nVery easy decision for me giving it a 10 out of 10.\\n\\nBeautifull young korean actresses with some great scenes.\\n\\n8 episodes not too long and simply perfect😉👍\\n\\nI would recommend this series highly👍👍 Its all worth it.',\n",
       " \"Man, I really thought we'd get to see some real destruction though. Like I know it's coming and super happy season 2 will be out in a few months because I got SOOO invested in this story I was ready! I guess though making us wait really does add to the slow burn that this show is all about. I mean 18 years she was planning so should've known this wouldn't go quickly. I think the acting is good! I mean sure revenge is a story we've all heard about before but I always like when they get creative. I feel like the next episodes will be just that. I also have no doubt we'll get to see everyone get just what's coming to them, along with answers to some burning questions! Easy to watch. Don't have many complaints. Keeping their names straight was the hardest part for me haha. Because sometimes they use all 3 and sometimes just 2, I just pulled up the cast on here and looked at the face if I got confused...so thank's for that IMDb.\\n\\nPart 2 did not disappoint! We got to see all the revenge plans come to fruition. Kept me guessing and had several surprises. Ended so well because it could absolutely be completely over and filling in the blanks wound be easy. I would love a 3rd edition so we can see how well the next reveng plays plays out though. I have no doubt there'd be many twists and turns along the way. I think this show is smart and well played. I hope to get more of it in the future.\",\n",
       " 'Maybe because I had such high expectations?\\n\\nRevenge stories are not my fav, admitedly. But I still sort of liked \"Again My Life\" and \"Itaewon Class\" is my second favourite drama of all times.\\n\\nSo... Let\\'s begin with what I liked.\\n\\nThe lady who was beaten by her husband. She may be the reason why I managed to watch to the end. Her acting was decent while her character was rather realistic. She was also fun and warm.\\n\\nYe-Sol\\'s father. The actor was handsome and his character was classy to the very end. The bits of romance he brought were the only ones that made my heart flutter.\\n\\nI also liked the tiny twist in the end, the reason the villainess will get a little more than what she was sentenced with. Not enough though.\\n\\nWhat I didn\\'t like.\\n\\nThe music. Dull. Discrepant. Useless. When it should have been there to enhance emotions, it only blurred them.\\n\\nThe acting. OMG. Is this a joke? The villains were caricatures. I mean, evil laughs, crazy laughs, lustful looks, nasty glances, yelling, swearing and throwing things across the room. That\\'s it. I couldn\\'t even hate or resent them. They didn\\'t feel like real people.\\n\\nSHK was beautiful of course, as ever. But so lifeless. She looked like a zombie. Not even a brain-craving zombie. Just a corpse walking about. No purpose. No energy, no presence, let alone charisma. With everything her charater went through, I couldn\\'t feel for her. I never even shed a tear or felt my heart tighten for her. I didn\\'t care. Her revenge itself was a mess, a combination of artificial luck and coincidences. Basically, she threw meat at a pack of wolves and waited for them to rip each other\\'s throats. Good idea, but her character was too weak to stand out in the fight, even as a triumphant spectator.\\n\\nI remember Park Seo-Jun in Itaewon Class. The burning rage, the relentless hatred, the drive. He looked like a super nova.\\n\\nOn the contrary, SHK looked like a cold rock... I realize hers is a character who is supposed to be broken, dead even if still walking, an empty vessel whose soul was simply erased. I think this is what the director was looking achieve and he succeeded, but as a result, I couldn\\'t relate to the victim. I felt no sympathy for her. A mere rock. Not even a blade.\\n\\nCome to think about it, I wouldn\\' say SHK is a great actress. I love her looks but I noticed more than once how rigid her acting could be. In \"Encounter\" she was already this cold and lifeless. Again, I blamed it on the character. I\\'m not so sure now. She was exactly the same in \"That Winter The WInd Blows\". Maybe better in \"The Full House?\"\\n\\nAt any rate. This show was so and so. No real flaws. Worth watching (not sure why), but nothing special.\\n\\nAh. If there is a third season. I won\\'t watch. Not that there is anything to ruin. Just... Not interested.',\n",
       " \"In the first part of the show, it's scary to watch that young adults are so devil! You feel sad for the victims.\\n\\nIn the second part of the show, you feel hatred & feel like taking revenge for FL! Unbelievable to see the rich manipulate others to do their dirty work for them & get away with murder!\\n\\nThat kind of mother shouldn't exist!\\n\\n18 years of planning, she should be prepared for any fallout. Even if her mother finds her, why let her into her life!\\n\\nThe 2nd part is awesome! Loved the ending. The chemistry between the ML & FL. The ending is awesome! The bullies suffer & retribution!\\n\\nHighly recommended!\",\n",
       " \"The Glory exceeded expectations! This is one of the rare kdramas that managed to start off with a strong captivating story and held that pacing to the very end. There was zero wasted scenes nor any dull/draggy moments.\\n\\nThe acting in this drama was top notch! Soon Hy-kyo was solid in her performance of someone with hidden pain (physically and mentally). Lim Ji-yeon, Cha Joo-Young were so perfect in capturing the very duality of two-faced characters. At times I couldn't even hate Lim Ji-Yeon's character because of the depth she went to to capture the evilness of the character. Yeon Hye-ran was probably my favorite as Mrs. Kang as she manages to put some humor into an otherwise very painful story arc. When she was eating in the car and laughing at a news forum, that was such a pure moment for that character.\\n\\nThe pacing is fantastic. Never once did it let up on its suspense and mystery.

I am still waiting for a brilliant writer like this one to stop the histrionics and go after the criminals and their supporters carefully and methodically and legally until they are expelled and imprisoned.

       " \"Never been the first review before! I watched the first season throughout one day, a bit sped up because it tends to drag out. I recently watched My Name, so I was definitely getting flashbacks a lot, it's like a cleaner, Sky Castle-ish version (in terms of overall atmosphere, how slow it is, how everyone is unexplainably a rich jerk, but they're all good actors). My Name was definitely superior.\\n\\nI won't say I enjoy the female lead's constant lack of expression, but I was intrigued by the story and wanted to see what happens. I don't normally watch series unless all seasons are out but somehow I felt I won't mind this time, we've all seen it before, similar themes/plots, etc.\\n\\nIf this was my first Kdrama I'd be horrified by the bullying. I feel I've become desensitized to it after a couple of years. This can't be a good thing. So I don't get why Kdramas have to rely so heavily on this concept. Especially when it's overly dramatic/over the top but not at all justified/explained.\\n\\nHowever, I can't help but always think how a nation that takes politeness so seriously, it's even built in their language, plus all the constant bowing etc, can be so unexplainably and viciously rude and mean. Or does one explain the other? Personally I advocate for language reform lol but I don't see it happening any time soon. However I don't see any other solution for these kids to not go through trauma like that. And then also have their trauma dramaticized, that's a weird cycle to keep perpetuating, even if the element of revenge seems cathartic. I'm not sure it actually is.\\n\\nBut I can't say for sure until after Season 2 which will be released a couple of months from now.\",\n",

In this case, despite being poor and powerless, our heroine has the guts to confront and taunt them face-to-face, \"your time is up\", with a deadly cool smile that sends shivers down their spine. If this is not class, I don\\'t know what is.\\n\\nThis is modern Korean thriller at it\\'s best. If the story were to take place in US, the victim of school violence (or torture to be precise) would likely just grab an assault rifle from home (for self-defense purposes only of couse) and shoot dead her tormenters. A much more efficient approach certainly but the drama would be over in one episode...

       " '\"There will be no forgiveness, and so... there will be no glory either.\" - Moon Dong-eun\\n\\nThe Glory is a South Korean television-series written and executive produced by Kim Eun-sook, who molds a harrowing tale about a disfigured victim of high school violence who carefully plots her revenge against those that have wronged her. Song Hye-kyo delivers a commendable leading performance as the scorned woman, Moon Dong-eun, who has cashed in all her chips toward this path of no return. Ahn Gil-ho provides a masterful direction for the series. Allowing the viewer to take a backseat to this grand scheme orchestrated by Dong-eun, narrating every step of her growth to the leader of the oppressive group, Park Yeon-jin (Lim Ji-yeon) whom I must share was the perfect choice to portray an apathetic villainess. The casting for this series is impeccable as the performers handle their roles seemlessly. The storyline provides a valuable lesson to the audience on how you reap what you sow. Be weary of your actions and whom they may affect because everything in life has a price. The series contains social commentary on the upper class abusing their power and how they are able to evade heinous crimes such as human humiliation and abuse, tying into the severity of school bullying within South Korea. Showcasing very gruesome and grotesque scenes which are not for the faint of heart.\\n\\nThe series\\' weakness lies within it\\'s predictability as the viewer can already tell how this storyline is going to end. The theme feels familiar to other popular revenge stories such as \"Lady Vengeance\" and the \"Kill Bill\" duo-logy. But I believe the narrative is truly about the journey rather than the destination and this certainly has been a memorable experience as I unapologetically binge-watched the season in two days.

After studying and making some money , she returns only for revenge! (I cannot understand why she is doing something like that rather than living her life peacefully? )\\n\\nThe awful script continues with main actress's plan. To my mind, the plan has no reason of existence ,as she could just publish from the very beggining all the story about the school years' bullying.\\n\\nMoreover, the bad guys have not any depth in their characters. They were just stupid , extremely violent and ultra sexual human beings. We never learn anything about their psychology and the way they are led to be such craps.\\n\\nLast but not least , the love story. ONE OF THE WORST love story in kdrama's history. No chemistry between the cold-face actress and the young surgery boy. Every scene and dialogue between them is just too....cringy.\\n\\nI still can't understand why so much hype around this drama. In my opinion , this drama doesn't worth to watch it. There is no even a moral message. In the end bad and good guys are the same. Both are cruel and with no sense of humanity and that's sad.\\n\\nIn a world full of cruelty ,it's just disappointing to see that there isn't something to teach us how to be good.\",\n",

She makes the contact with her targets, you wait with baited breath for her next move. And then - the action slows, threads get intertwined and more and more characters have something to say. It's harder to make mental notes of what our protagonist is trying to achieve and a bit wild that noone is really pulling the strings to stop her so far. Everyone has a hidden story and it's getting messy keeping the tabs on all of them. At times it seems they are walking in circles and waiting. At times it's a bit confusing too. I've found myself speeding up to get to the end only to find out that it's not the end at all. Always check if the series you're bringing is finished.\\n\\nI hope the second part will be better.

But I still sort of liked \"Again My Life\" and \"Itaewon Class\" is my second favourite drama of all times.\\n\\nSo... Let\\'s begin with what I liked.\\n\\nThe lady who was beaten by her husband. She may be the reason why I managed to watch to the end. Her acting was decent while her character was rather realistic. She was also fun and warm.\\n\\nYe-Sol\\'s father. The actor was handsome and his character was classy to the very end. The bits of romance he brought were the only ones that made my heart flutter.\\n\\nI also liked the tiny twist in the end, the reason the villainess will get a little more than what she was sentenced with. Not enough though.\\n\\nWhat I didn\\'t like.\\n\\nThe music. Dull. Discrepant. Useless. When it should have been there to enhance emotions, it only blurred them.\\n\\nThe acting. OMG. Is this a joke? The villains were caricatures. I mean, evil laughs, crazy laughs, lustful looks, nasty glances, yelling, swearing and throwing things across the room. That\\'s it. I couldn\\'t even hate or resent them. They didn\\'t feel like real people.\\n\\nSHK was beautiful of course, as ever. But so lifeless. She looked like a zombie. Not even a brain-craving zombie. Just a corpse walking about. No purpose. No energy, no presence, let alone charisma. With everything her charater went through, I couldn\\'t feel for her. I never even shed a tear or felt my heart tighten for her. I didn\\'t care. Her revenge itself was a mess, a combination of artificial luck and coincidences. Basically, she threw meat at a pack of wolves and waited for them to rip each other\\'s throats. Good idea, but her character was too weak to stand out in the fight, even as a triumphant spectator.\\n\\nI remember Park Seo-Jun in Itaewon Class. The burning rage, the relentless hatred, the drive. He looked like a super nova.\\n\\nOn the contrary, SHK looked like a cold rock... I realize hers is a character who is supposed to be broken, dead even if still walking, an empty vessel whose soul was simply erased. I think this is what the director was looking achieve and he succeeded, but as a result, I couldn\\'t relate to the victim. I felt no sympathy for her. A mere rock. Not even a blade.\\n\\nCome to think about it, I wouldn\\' say SHK is a great actress. I love her looks but I noticed more than once how rigid her acting could be. In \"Encounter\" she was already this cold and lifeless. Again, I blamed it on the character. I\\'m not so sure now. She was exactly the same in \"That Winter The WInd Blows\". Maybe better in \"The Full House?\"\\n\\nAt any rate. This show was so and so. No real flaws. Worth watching (not sure why), but nothing special.\\n\\nAh. If there is a third season. I won\\'t watch. Not that there is anything to ruin. Just... Not interested.',\n",

       " \"Never been the first review before! I watched the first season throughout one day, a bit sped up because it tends to drag out. I recently watched My Name, so I was definitely getting flashbacks a lot, it's like a cleaner, Sky Castle-ish version (in terms of overall atmosphere, how slow it is, how everyone is unexplainably a rich jerk, but they're all good actors). My Name was definitely superior.\\n\\nI won't say I enjoy the female lead's constant lack of expression, but I was intrigued by the story and wanted to see what happens. I don't normally watch series unless all seasons are out but somehow I felt I won't mind this time, we've all seen it before, similar themes/plots, etc.\\n\\nIf this was my first Kdrama I'd be horrified by the bullying. I feel I've become desensitized to it after a couple of years. This can't be a good thing. So I don't get why Kdramas have to rely so heavily on this concept. Especially when it's overly dramatic/over the top but not at all justified/explained.\\n\\nHowever, I can't help but always think how a nation that takes politeness so seriously, it's even built in their language, plus all the constant bowing etc, can be so unexplainably and viciously rude and mean. Or does one explain the other? Personally I advocate for language reform lol but I don't see it happening any time soon. However I don't see any other solution for these kids to not go through trauma like that. And then also have their trauma dramaticized, that's a weird cycle to keep perpetuating, even if the element of revenge seems cathartic. I'm not sure it actually is.\\n\\nBut I can't say for sure until after Season 2 which will be released a couple of months from now.\",\n",

In this case, despite being poor and powerless, our heroine has the guts to confront and taunt them face-to-face, \"your time is up\", with a deadly cool smile that sends shivers down their spine. If this is not class, I don\\'t know what is.\\n\\nThis is modern Korean thriller at it\\'s best. If the story were to take place in US, the victim of school violence (or torture to be precise) would likely just grab an assault rifle from home (for self-defense purposes only of couse) and shoot dead her tormenters. A much more efficient approach certainly but the drama would be over in one episode... Here we get to watch each move our heroine makes like the Go master she is evolving into, making small wins one after another. But will she ultimately prevail? And if so at what cost?

They strive for perfection on those fields and it usually works.\\n\\nI'm not a huge fan of heavy revenge tragedy because the endings seem to come out as either cliché or rushed for me most times. In this series however, the story was able to arrive somewhere despite having a few loose ends.

I loved that the show, for the most part, departed from the typical overly dramatic cheesy romance like many other dramas.\\n\\nThat's where the show shines the most, when it's focused on the crime and suspense. The show starts off really well and pace really well past the midpoint where it becomes really sloppy.\\n\\nWhile I completely understand the motive of the lead woman, she's extremely boring, stone-faced, one-dimensional, and not very enjoyable to watch. Surprisingly all of the best moments are moments showing other characters. The dullest moments are those with her and her depressing obsessed doctor follower.\\n\\nSeriously? Even as cringy, annoying, whiny, and obsessed so many people are in most Korean dramas are, Joo Yeo-Jung takes the cake. His obsession and 'love' for Moon feels soo unnatural, out of place, and unwarranted it really waters down the rest of the show.\\n\\nI'd score the show two points higher if they removed him (or the weird awkward chemistry) from the main plot.

       " \"Edit 3/17/23\\n\\nSeason 1 opinion: Being that I've lived in South Korea for over 4 years now, I can say revenge dramas are a dime a dozen. There's always one playing on TV, and some of them are moderately interesting.\\n\\nThis one is by far the worst of any I've seen. If you put me in a coma, my acting would be equal to the main character. The female characters are catty, shallow psychopaths, and the male characters are complete simps, willing to do anything, and I mean anything, for a bland, soulless woman who is wholly uninterested in talking with anybody. The one older lady, who also stars in The Uncanny Counter (an action drama), is the only one that stands out as likeable and with acting skills.\\n\\nThe injustice part of the plot seems pretty unbelievable and gratuitous. The rest of the time, literally nothing happens. The main character just teaches a class, ghosts simps, and stands on her balcony eating a sandwich. How on Earth did they make a show out of this, for one, and how did anybody enjoy it? I gave it two stars because I was so disinterested in the story that I was able to use it for Korean listening practice without getting drawn in by the plot.\\n\\nSeason 2 opinion: Better than season 1, but still plenty of plot holes, strange editing choices, and confusing plot lines, I kept trying to figure out who was who, and why they were in the story. Some plot lines fizzle out unresolved, I would guess, because there were too many to keep track of.\\n\\nThat being said, a least things happen in this season, and in one episode, the main character had to do some acting, and she did fine. The character that played her mom, though...ugh. That was pretty rough.\\n\\nTo end on a good note, the cinematography team did a great job. I bumped it up from a 2/10 to 4/10 half because of them, and half because season 2 was an overall improvement.\",\n",
       " \"So bloated. This could have had 5 episodes trimmed off and been a very good show.\\n\\nThe good stuff. Acting was pretty damn good. I am very hard to get positives from on this cos so many actors are bad but there were a few stand outs. If you exclude the main male role - the doctor, who could be replaced by a wooden puppet then the acting was good - excellent.\\n\\nThe quality overall was good. Well polished and felt modern. The writing though was not great. The characters were quite well developed but the story wasn't. It could have had some huge twists and turned in to this big ending but instead you just get trickle fed a revenge plot. As the synopsis reads very similar to that of Japanese film Confessions, where school teacher takes revenge, this was not even close to the scale of revenge satisfaction that film gave.\\n\\nI guess my overall feeling at the end was I'd rather have watched Confessions again and saved 14 hours of my life.\\n\\nTo sum up it was really good but a missed opportunity and needlessly long. 16 episodes is standard for K-Dramas, so they should be experts at pacing 16 episodes by now.\\n\\nPlease no more Shamans too. It totally detracts by being too weird.\",\n",
       " \"This Korean drama is centred on Moon Dong-eun, a woman who was appallingly bullied when she was at school. Now she is determined to have her revenge; especially against Park Yeon-jin, her chief tormentor. Dong-eun has been left with physical scars but she knows Yeon-jin is responsible for another girl's death. To aid her in her mission Dong-eun enlists the help of Kang Hyeon-nam, a victim of domestic violence.\\n\\nI found this to be a gripping, if somewhat gruelling drama. Thankfully the most disturbing events take place in the opening episode so if you can make it past these you should be okay. The characters are interesting; plenty are clearly villainous but the 'good' ones have a degree of moral ambiguity. There aren't too many laughs to be had but those that are come from Hyeon-nam as she attempts to get information on Dong-eun's targets. The cast does a really fine job making their characters believable even if occasionally the antagonists slip into pantomime villain territory. Overall I'd definitely recommend this to fans of darker toned Korean drama.\\n\\nThese comments are based on watching the series in Korean with English subtitles.\",\n",

       " '\"There will be no forgiveness, and so... there will be no glory either.\" - Moon Dong-eun\\n\\nThe Glory is a South Korean television-series written and executive produced by Kim Eun-sook, who molds a harrowing tale about a disfigured victim of high school violence who carefully plots her revenge against those that have wronged her. Song Hye-kyo delivers a commendable leading performance as the scorned woman, Moon Dong-eun, who has cashed in all her chips toward this path of no return. Ahn Gil-ho provides a masterful direction for the series. Allowing the viewer to take a backseat to this grand scheme orchestrated by Dong-eun, narrating every step of her growth to the leader of the oppressive group, Park Yeon-jin (Lim Ji-yeon) whom I must share was the perfect choice to portray an apathetic villainess. The casting for this series is impeccable as the performers handle their roles seemlessly. The storyline provides a valuable lesson to the audience on how you reap what you sow. Be weary of your actions and whom they may affect because everything in life has a price. The series contains social commentary on the upper class abusing their power and how they are able to evade heinous crimes such as human humiliation and abuse, tying into the severity of school bullying within South Korea. Showcasing very gruesome and grotesque scenes which are not for the faint of heart.\\n\\nThe series\\' weakness lies within it\\'s predictability as the viewer can already tell how this storyline is going to end. The theme feels familiar to other popular revenge stories such as \"Lady Vengeance\" and the \"Kill Bill\" duo-logy. But I believe the narrative is truly about the journey rather than the destination and this certainly has been a memorable experience as I unapologetically binge-watched the season in two days.

After studying and making some money , she returns only for revenge!

To my mind, the plan has no reason of existence ,as she could just publish from the very beggining all the story about the school years' bullying.\\n\\nMoreover, the bad guys have not any depth in their characters. They were just stupid , extremely violent and ultra sexual human beings. We never learn anything about their psychology and the way they are led to be such craps.\\n\\nLast but not least , the love story. ONE OF THE WORST love story in kdrama's history. No chemistry between the cold-face actress and the young surgery boy. Every scene and dialogue between them is just too....cringy.\\n\\nI still can't understand why so much hype around this drama. In my opinion , this drama doesn't worth to watch it. There is no even a moral message. In the end bad and good guys are the same. Both are cruel and with no sense of humanity and that's sad.\\n\\nIn a world full of cruelty ,it's just disappointing to see that there isn't something to teach us how to be good.\",\n",

She makes the contact with her targets, you wait with baited breath for her next move. And then - the action slows, threads get intertwined and more and more characters have something to say. It's harder to make mental notes of what our protagonist is trying to achieve and a bit wild that noone is really pulling the strings to stop her so far. Everyone has a hidden story and it's getting messy keeping the tabs on all of them. At times it seems they are walking in circles and waiting. At times it's a bit confusing too.

She may be the reason why I managed to watch to the end. Her acting was decent while her character was rather realistic. She was also fun and warm.\\n\\nYe-Sol\\'s father. The actor was handsome and his character was classy to the very end. The bits of romance he brought were the only ones that made my heart flutter.\\n\\nI also liked the tiny twist in the end, the reason the villainess will get a little more than what she was sentenced with. Not enough though.\\n\\nWhat I didn\\'t like.\\n\\nThe music. Dull. Discrepant. Useless. When it should have been there to enhance emotions, it only blurred them.\\n\\nThe acting. OMG. Is this a joke? The villains were caricatures. I mean, evil laughs, crazy laughs, lustful looks, nasty glances, yelling, swearing and throwing things across the room. That\\'s it. I couldn\\'t even hate or resent them. They didn\\'t feel like real people.\\n\\nSHK was beautiful of course, as ever. But so lifeless. She looked like a zombie. Not even a brain-craving zombie. Just a corpse walking about. No purpose. No energy, no presence, let alone charisma. With everything her charater went through, I couldn\\'t feel for her. I never even shed a tear or felt my heart tighten for her. I didn\\'t care. Her revenge itself was a mess, a combination of artificial luck and coincidences. Basically, she threw meat at a pack of wolves and waited for them to rip each other\\'s throats. Good idea, but her character was too weak to stand out in the fight, even as a triumphant spectator.\\n\\nI remember Park Seo-Jun in Itaewon Class. The burning rage, the relentless hatred, the drive. He looked like a super nova.\\n\\nOn the contrary, SHK looked like a cold rock... I realize hers is a character who is supposed to be broken, dead even if still walking, an empty vessel whose soul was simply erased. I think this is what the director was looking achieve and he succeeded, but as a result, I couldn\\'t relate to the victim. I felt no sympathy for her. A mere rock. Not even a blade.\\n\\nCome to think about it, I wouldn\\' say SHK is a great actress. I love her looks but I noticed more than once how rigid her acting could be. In \"Encounter\" she was already this cold and lifeless. Again, I blamed it on the character. I\\'m not so sure now. She was exactly the same in \"That Winter The WInd Blows\". Maybe better in \"The Full House?\"\\n\\nAt any rate. This show was so and so. No real flaws. Worth watching (not sure why), but nothing special.\\n\\nAh. If there is a third season. I won\\'t watch.

       " \"The Glory exceeded expectations! This is one of the rare kdramas that managed to start off with a strong captivating story and held that pacing to the very end. There was zero wasted scenes nor any dull/draggy moments.\\n\\nThe acting in this drama was top notch! Soon Hy-kyo was solid in her performance of someone with hidden pain (physically and mentally). Lim Ji-yeon, Cha Joo-Young were so perfect in capturing the very duality of two-faced characters. At times I couldn't even hate Lim Ji-Yeon's character because of the depth she went to to capture the evilness of the character. Yeon Hye-ran was probably my favorite as Mrs. Kang as she manages to put some humor into an otherwise very painful story arc. When she was eating in the car and laughing at a news forum, that was such a pure moment for that character.\\n\\nThe pacing is fantastic. Never once did it let up on its suspense and mystery. It kept hold of it's suspense through a well executed plot that uses each scene to present a piece of the puzzle and wastes no time in long drawn out expositions.\\n\\nAlso the cinematography, camera angles and editing are worth noting. The scenes are cut in such a way that it uses a theme to lead into one another using a very artistic flare. IE a candy wrapper, that we believe to be from Mrs. Kang's bag, floating across a parking lot to the feet of another character but at a different moment than we expected. Many small elements like that sprinkled throughout the show to give you subtle hints using cuts, props, set dec pieces .\\n\\nOverall THUMBS UP! Do check it out!\",\n",

Assault is a crime no matter the age or the perpetrators\\' roles whether directly attacking, or making the attacks possible.

I am still waiting for a brilliant writer like this one to stop the histrionics and go after the criminals and their supporters carefully and methodically and legally until they are expelled and imprisoned.

       " \"Never been the first review before! I watched the first season throughout one day, a bit sped up because it tends to drag out. I recently watched My Name, so I was definitely getting flashbacks a lot, it's like a cleaner, Sky Castle-ish version (in terms of overall atmosphere, how slow it is, how everyone is unexplainably a rich jerk, but they're all good actors). My Name was definitely superior.\\n\\nI won't say I enjoy the female lead's constant lack of expression, but I was intrigued by the story and wanted to see what happens. I don't normally watch series unless all seasons are out but somehow I felt I won't mind this time, we've all seen it before, similar themes/plots, etc.\\n\\nIf this was my first Kdrama I'd be horrified by the bullying. I feel I've become desensitized to it after a couple of years. This can't be a good thing. So I don't get why Kdramas have to rely so heavily on this concept. Especially when it's overly dramatic/over the top but not at all justified/explained.\\n\\nHowever, I can't help but always think how a nation that takes politeness so seriously, it's even built in their language, plus all the constant bowing etc, can be so unexplainably and viciously rude and mean. Or does one explain the other? Personally I advocate for language reform lol but I don't see it happening any time soon. However I don't see any other solution for these kids to not go through trauma like that. And then also have their trauma dramaticized, that's a weird cycle to keep perpetuating, even if the element of revenge seems cathartic. I'm not sure it actually is.\\n\\nBut I can't say for sure until after Season 2 which will be released a couple of months from now.\",\n",

If this is not class, I don\\'t know what is.\\n\\nThis is modern Korean thriller at it\\'s best. If the story were to take place in US, the victim of school violence (or torture to be precise) would likely just grab an assault rifle from home (for self-defense purposes only of couse) and shoot dead her tormenters.

In this series however, the story was able to arrive somewhere despite having a few loose ends.

I loved that the show, for the most part, departed from the typical overly dramatic cheesy romance like many other dramas.\\n\\nThat's where the show shines the most, when it's focused on the crime and suspense. The show starts off really well and pace really well past the midpoint where it becomes really sloppy.\\n\\nWhile I completely understand the motive of the lead woman, she's extremely boring, stone-faced, one-dimensional, and not very enjoyable to watch. Surprisingly all of the best moments are moments showing other characters. The dullest moments are those with her and her depressing obsessed doctor follower.\\n\\nSeriously? Even as cringy, annoying, whiny, and obsessed so many people are in most Korean dramas are, Joo Yeo-Jung takes the cake.

       " \"Edit 3/17/23\\n\\nSeason 1 opinion: Being that I've lived in South Korea for over 4 years now, I can say revenge dramas are a dime a dozen. There's always one playing on TV, and some of them are moderately interesting.\\n\\nThis one is by far the worst of any I've seen. If you put me in a coma, my acting would be equal to the main character. The female characters are catty, shallow psychopaths, and the male characters are complete simps, willing to do anything, and I mean anything, for a bland, soulless woman who is wholly uninterested in talking with anybody. The one older lady, who also stars in The Uncanny Counter (an action drama), is the only one that stands out as likeable and with acting skills.\\n\\nThe injustice part of the plot seems pretty unbelievable and gratuitous. The rest of the time, literally nothing happens. The main character just teaches a class, ghosts simps, and stands on her balcony eating a sandwich. How on Earth did they make a show out of this, for one, and how did anybody enjoy it? I gave it two stars because I was so disinterested in the story that I was able to use it for Korean listening practice without getting drawn in by the plot.\\n\\nSeason 2 opinion: Better than season 1, but still plenty of plot holes, strange editing choices, and confusing plot lines, I kept trying to figure out who was who, and why they were in the story. Some plot lines fizzle out unresolved, I would guess, because there were too many to keep track of.\\n\\nThat being said, a least things happen in this season, and in one episode, the main character had to do some acting, and she did fine. The character that played her mom, though...ugh. That was pretty rough.\\n\\nTo end on a good note, the cinematography team did a great job. I bumped it up from a 2/10 to 4/10 half because of them, and half because season 2 was an overall improvement.\",\n",
       " \"So bloated. This could have had 5 episodes trimmed off and been a very good show.\\n\\nThe good stuff. Acting was pretty damn good. I am very hard to get positives from on this cos so many actors are bad but there were a few stand outs. If you exclude the main male role - the doctor, who could be replaced by a wooden puppet then the acting was good - excellent.\\n\\nThe quality overall was good. Well polished and felt modern. The writing though was not great. The characters were quite well developed but the story wasn't. It could have had some huge twists and turned in to this big ending but instead you just get trickle fed a revenge plot. As the synopsis reads very similar to that of Japanese film Confessions, where school teacher takes revenge, this was not even close to the scale of revenge satisfaction that film gave.\\n\\nI guess my overall feeling at the end was I'd rather have watched Confessions again and saved 14 hours of my life.\\n\\nTo sum up it was really good but a missed opportunity and needlessly long. 16 episodes is standard for K-Dramas, so they should be experts at pacing 16 episodes by now.\\n\\nPlease no more Shamans too. It totally detracts by being too weird.\",\n",
       " \"This Korean drama is centred on Moon Dong-eun, a woman who was appallingly bullied when she was at school. Now she is determined to have her revenge; especially against Park Yeon-jin, her chief tormentor. Dong-eun has been left with physical scars but she knows Yeon-jin is responsible for another girl's death. To aid her in her mission Dong-eun enlists the help of Kang Hyeon-nam, a victim of domestic violence.\\n\\nI found this to be a gripping, if somewhat gruelling drama. Thankfully the most disturbing events take place in the opening episode so if you can make it past these you should be okay. The characters are interesting; plenty are clearly villainous but the 'good' ones have a degree of moral ambiguity. There aren't too many laughs to be had but those that are come from Hyeon-nam as she attempts to get information on Dong-eun's targets. The cast does a really fine job making their characters believable even if occasionally the antagonists slip into pantomime villain territory.

       " \"The Glory: South Korean revenge thriller series which strays into the horror zone. Like many SK TV series' this has 16, hour long episodes which can prove a bit daunting even when the early episodes are quiet good. In this case it was split into two parts. The first i gave 9/10, the second 7/10. Truly disturbing school bullying involving physical abuse and bought off/indifferent teachers and police. It doesn't help that bullying victim Moon Dong-eun (Song Hye-kyo) has an alcoholic mother who is also easily bribed.

The adult Dong-eun sets out to take revenge on the gang of bullies, confronting them, inserting herself into their lives. Naturally they fight back. A lot of psychological horror but there are some really disturbing scenes of violence. Shamanism also features with some impressive scenes of possession.

Also, it is clear that although there are many inconsistencies in the story, especially in the police investigation, the whole plot should be seen primarily on a symbolic and metaphorical level. The relationships between the characters are well developed, and it is especially impressive to see how the characters themselves change as the story progresses and find themselves in new situations. This is especially true for Ha Do-Young.\\n\\nThe ending is a little melodramatic, but it fits well since the whole story is quite painful. Also, there is too much mixing of plot from different time periods which just makes it harder to follow.\\n\\nAll in all, a good series that is certainly not for those who want to watch something along the way for fun, but it is a good display of different characters with a special emphasis on evil people (that's the majority) who are irreparable until the end. No one had the slightest remorse for what they had done, but only felt sorry for themselves and looked to get out of their own problems regardless of who they hurt.\",\n",

Normally I hate flashbacks in a movie or series but in this story, well used. You can understand trauma behind of main character and it is really sad. Only one thing is annoying me about Korean series ; actors or actresses laugh so strange. It is so fake.. It is really good.

       " 'A revenge drama can be hard to watch. Especially if you allow the fact that revenge is a poor basis for justice to interfere with your going with the flow of the drama. This series largely avoids that problem through the nasties being agents of their own downfall. The victim seeking revenge does not kill or maim her targets. She manipulates them into doing that to each other.\\n\\nThat is possible because the nasties are such awful people. Of course anyone who bullies to the extent they bullied the victim at school is likely to grow up to be an awful nasty, so I had no issue with that. More problematic for me was that they would continue as \"friends\" into adult life despite being so horrible to each other. Their constant abuse of each other was fertile ground on which the victim could sow sufficient discord for their group to implode.\\n\\nI also felt that one or two of the revenge outcomes were a little too easy - for example the death of the abusive teacher required little effort from the victim.\\n\\nThe darkness of the storyline was partly redeemed by a love story - this is a kdrama after all!

       " '\"There will be no forgiveness, and so... there will be no glory either.\" - Moon Dong-eun\\n\\nThe Glory is a South Korean television-series written and executive produced by Kim Eun-sook, who molds a harrowing tale about a disfigured victim of high school violence who carefully plots her revenge against those that have wronged her. Song Hye-kyo delivers a commendable leading performance as the scorned woman, Moon Dong-eun, who has cashed in all her chips toward this path of no return. Ahn Gil-ho provides a masterful direction for the series. Allowing the viewer to take a backseat to this grand scheme orchestrated by Dong-eun, narrating every step of her growth to the leader of the oppressive group, Park Yeon-jin (Lim Ji-yeon) whom I must share was the perfect choice to portray an apathetic villainess. The casting for this series is impeccable as the performers handle their roles seemlessly. The storyline provides a valuable lesson to the audience on how you reap what you sow. Be weary of your actions and whom they may affect because everything in life has a price. The series contains social commentary on the upper class abusing their power and how they are able to evade heinous crimes such as human humiliation and abuse, tying into the severity of school bullying within South Korea. Showcasing very gruesome and grotesque scenes which are not for the faint of heart.\\n\\nThe series\\' weakness lies within it\\'s predictability as the viewer can already tell how this storyline is going to end. The theme feels familiar to other popular revenge stories such as \"Lady Vengeance\" and the \"Kill Bill\" duo-logy. But I believe the narrative is truly about the journey rather than the destination and this certainly has been a memorable experience as I unapologetically binge-watched the season in two days. I am looking forward to the release of Part 2 and the conclusion of this potently written drama.\\n\\nIG: thecinephilereviews.',\n",
       " \"The first episode starts with an interesting way , with the story of a gang which makes the worst bullying in some of their classmates .\\n\\nBut the interest stops here. The storyline development continues with a very weird way. The main lead makes a come back in her bullies' lives in order to get revenge for all of her traumas. After studying and making some money , she returns only for revenge! (I cannot understand why she is doing something like that rather than living her life peacefully? )\\n\\nThe awful script continues with main actress's plan. To my mind, the plan has no reason of existence ,as she could just publish from the very beggining all the story about the school years' bullying.\\n\\nMoreover, the bad guys have not any depth in their characters. They were just stupid , extremely violent and ultra sexual human beings. We never learn anything about their psychology and the way they are led to be such craps.\\n\\nLast but not least , the love story. ONE OF THE WORST love story in kdrama's history. No chemistry between the cold-face actress and the young surgery boy. Every scene and dialogue between them is just too....cringy.\\n\\nI still can't understand why so much hype around this drama. In my opinion , this drama doesn't worth to watch it. There is no even a moral message. In the end bad and good guys are the same. Both are cruel and with no sense of humanity and that's sad.\\n\\nIn a world full of cruelty ,it's just disappointing to see that there isn't something to teach us how to be good.\",\n",

I'm not an expert but I think his acting is far the best in this TV show.\\n\\nAlso other actors and actress are excellent, the main character, performed by Song Hye-Kyo, is so intense.\\n\\nI liked very much the plot, the character design and the photograph of the scenes.\\n\\nThe run toward the riff of the evil bullies make you stick to the screen and you cannot leave.\\n\\nI'm not used to binge a tv show, but in this case you cannot skip.\",\n",
       " \"So the series starts well, as well as revenge story can go. After the first episode you find yourself both excited for some deserved belated retribution and horrified at what you've just witnessed. The plan is in motion, even if it takes 18 years.\\n\\nWe are following Dong-Eun as she climbs step by step towards her revenge and all is well. She makes the contact with her targets, you wait with baited breath for her next move. And then - the action slows, threads get intertwined and more and more characters have something to say. It's harder to make mental notes of what our protagonist is trying to achieve and a bit wild that noone is really pulling the strings to stop her so far. Everyone has a hidden story and it's getting messy keeping the tabs on all of them. At times it seems they are walking in circles and waiting. At times it's a bit confusing too. I've found myself speeding up to get to the end only to find out that it's not the end at all. Always check if the series you're bringing is finished.\\n\\nI hope the second part will be better. It seems like they are capable of very dark things and I got the impression that's where we're headed. I just found myself dissappointed at how muddy the middle part got and I really hope the script will be sharp and crisp for the next part. This series has a potential for exceptionally twisted story, otherwise it's another dull revenge plot.\",\n",
       " 'Born on the wrong side of the tracks, high school girl Moon Dong-eun (Song Hye-kyo, Jung Ji-so) got brutally bullied by rich peers. Not just with the usual slapping, hair-pulling or public shaming, but with means that would leave lasting marks all over her body. After realizing that even the school administration not only could not help her, but would even join in the bullying, she dropped out. She worked menial jobs to get an education degree and save money towards a revenge plan.\\n\\nIn the meantime, her bullies went on to lead comfortable lives - a famous weather forecaster of a broadcast station with a sweet daughter and a CEO husband, a golf course executive and his lackey, a famous artist, an airline stewardess and an awarded school administrator.\\n\\nThe story is intense. The bullying is horrific, making me wonder whether Korean kids are really this mean, having watched similar bullying scenes in The Penthouse and other kdramas. However, I haven\\'t gotten drawn into any character as much as I would have wanted to. And after watching a seemingly endless parade of revenge-centric dramas, I am getting bored with this plot device. I was actually surprised at how revenge-driven this is, making it rather archaic. Even Chinese dramas, known for revenge plots, are now depicting stories that advocate love, peace and forgiveness.\\n\\nWith a protagonist that has so much hatred in her as to hatch such a revenge plan, I doubt she can really love anybody, thus, I find any \"love\" angle in this drama implausible.\\n\\nI am still giving this a decent rating as the revenge was done not only for the protagonist\\'s sake but also to serve justice for the murder of another bullying victim, though it begs the question: did the protagonist use the other girl\\'s death to avenge herself?',\n",

Like I know it's coming and super happy season 2 will be out in a few months because I got SOOO invested in this story I was ready! I guess though making us wait really does add to the slow burn that this show is all about. I mean 18 years she was planning so should've known this wouldn't go quickly. I think the acting is good! I mean sure revenge is a story we've all heard about before but I always like when they get creative. I feel like the next episodes will be just that. I also have no doubt we'll get to see everyone get just what's coming to them, along with answers to some burning questions! Easy to watch. Don't have many complaints. Keeping their names straight was the hardest part for me haha. Because sometimes they use all 3 and sometimes just 2, I just pulled up the cast on here and looked at the face if I got confused...so thank's for that IMDb.\\n\\nPart 2 did not disappoint! We got to see all the revenge plans come to fruition. Kept me guessing and had several surprises. Ended so well because it could absolutely be completely over and filling in the blanks wound be easy. I would love a 3rd edition so we can see how well the next reveng plays plays out though. I have no doubt there'd be many twists and turns along the way. I think this show is smart and well played. I hope to get more of it in the future.\",\n",
       " 'Maybe because I had such high expectations?\\n\\nRevenge stories are not my fav, admitedly. But I still sort of liked \"Again My Life\" and \"Itaewon Class\" is my second favourite drama of all times.\\n\\nSo... Let\\'s begin with what I liked.\\n\\nThe lady who was beaten by her husband. She may be the reason why I managed to watch to the end. Her acting was decent while her character was rather realistic. She was also fun and warm.\\n\\nYe-Sol\\'s father. The actor was handsome and his character was classy to the very end. The bits of romance he brought were the only ones that made my heart flutter.\\n\\nI also liked the tiny twist in the end, the reason the villainess will get a little more than what she was sentenced with. Not enough though.\\n\\nWhat I didn\\'t like.\\n\\nThe music. Dull. Discrepant. Useless. When it should have been there to enhance emotions, it only blurred them.\\n\\nThe acting. OMG. Is this a joke? The villains were caricatures. I mean, evil laughs, crazy laughs, lustful looks, nasty glances, yelling, swearing and throwing things across the room. That\\'s it. I couldn\\'t even hate or resent them. They didn\\'t feel like real people.\\n\\nSHK was beautiful of course, as ever. But so lifeless. She looked like a zombie. Not even a brain-craving zombie. Just a corpse walking about. No purpose. No energy, no presence, let alone charisma. With everything her charater went through, I couldn\\'t feel for her. I never even shed a tear or felt my heart tighten for her. I didn\\'t care. Her revenge itself was a mess, a combination of artificial luck and coincidences. Basically, she threw meat at a pack of wolves and waited for them to rip each other\\'s throats. Good idea, but her character was too weak to stand out in the fight, even as a triumphant spectator.\\n\\nI remember Park Seo-Jun in Itaewon Class. The burning rage, the relentless hatred, the drive. He looked like a super nova.\\n\\nOn the contrary, SHK looked like a cold rock... I realize hers is a character who is supposed to be broken, dead even if still walking, an empty vessel whose soul was simply erased. I think this is what the director was looking achieve and he succeeded, but as a result, I couldn\\'t relate to the victim. I felt no sympathy for her. A mere rock. Not even a blade.\\n\\nCome to think about it, I wouldn\\' say SHK is a great actress. I love her looks but I noticed more than once how rigid her acting could be. In \"Encounter\" she was already this cold and lifeless. Again, I blamed it on the character. I\\'m not so sure now. She was exactly the same in \"That Winter The WInd Blows\". Maybe better in \"The Full House?\"\\n\\nAt any rate. This show was so and so. No real flaws. Worth watching (not sure why), but nothing special.\\n\\nAh. If there is a third season. I won\\'t watch. Not that there is anything to ruin. Just... Not interested.',\n",
       " \"In the first part of the show, it's scary to watch that young adults are so devil!

Unbelievable to see the rich manipulate others to do their dirty work for them & get away with murder!\\n\\nThat kind of mother shouldn't exist!\\n\\n18 years of planning, she should be prepared for any fallout. Even if her mother finds her, why let her into her life!\\n\\nThe 2nd part is awesome! Loved the ending. The chemistry between the ML & FL. The ending is awesome!

There was zero wasted scenes nor any dull/draggy moments.\\n\\nThe acting in this drama was top notch! Soon Hy-kyo was solid in her performance of someone with hidden pain (physically and mentally). Lim Ji-yeon, Cha Joo-Young were so perfect in capturing the very duality of two-faced characters. At times I couldn't even hate Lim Ji-Yeon's character because of the depth she went to to capture the evilness of the character. Yeon Hye-ran was probably my favorite as Mrs. Kang as she manages to put some humor into an otherwise very painful story arc. When she was eating in the car and laughing at a news forum, that was such a pure moment for that character.\\n\\nThe pacing is fantastic. Never once did it let up on its suspense and mystery. It kept hold of it's suspense through a well executed plot that uses each scene to present a piece of the puzzle and wastes no time in long drawn out expositions.\\n\\nAlso the cinematography, camera angles and editing are worth noting. The scenes are cut in such a way that it uses a theme to lead into one another using a very artistic flare. IE a candy wrapper, that we believe to be from Mrs. Kang's bag, floating across a parking lot to the feet of another character but at a different moment than we expected. Many small elements like that sprinkled throughout the show to give you subtle hints using cuts, props, set dec pieces .\\n\\nOverall THUMBS UP! Do check it out!\",\n",

Rather than the numerous drama series showing the criminals attacking other students always with impunity, expose physical and verbal assault in the school system for what it is: a crime punishable by expulsion and imprisonment.\\n\\nFor the victim to become obsessed and as vicious as the criminals-while understandable-makes her no better. I am still waiting for a brilliant writer like this one to stop the histrionics and go after the criminals and their supporters carefully and methodically and legally until they are expelled and imprisoned. Because it never should have gone as far as it was allowed. And it won\\'t stop until it is exposed and punished in the courts. That said, everyone in this drama is excellent.

Somehow I was expecting a more intelligent, cold and calculated plan. I was hoping for that explosive element of surprise but never came.\\n\\nDont get me wrong, still a very well written script, there were no holes and the execution was impeccable.

       " \"Never been the first review before! I watched the first season throughout one day, a bit sped up because it tends to drag out. I recently watched My Name, so I was definitely getting flashbacks a lot, it's like a cleaner, Sky Castle-ish version (in terms of overall atmosphere, how slow it is, how everyone is unexplainably a rich jerk, but they're all good actors). My Name was definitely superior.\\n\\nI won't say I enjoy the female lead's constant lack of expression, but I was intrigued by the story and wanted to see what happens. I don't normally watch series unless all seasons are out but somehow I felt I won't mind this time, we've all seen it before, similar themes/plots, etc.\\n\\nIf this was my first Kdrama I'd be horrified by the bullying. I feel I've become desensitized to it after a couple of years. This can't be a good thing. So I don't get why Kdramas have to rely so heavily on this concept. Especially when it's overly dramatic/over the top but not at all justified/explained.\\n\\nHowever, I can't help but always think how a nation that takes politeness so seriously, it's even built in their language, plus all the constant bowing etc, can be so unexplainably and viciously rude and mean. Or does one explain the other? Personally I advocate for language reform lol but I don't see it happening any time soon. However I don't see any other solution for these kids to not go through trauma like that. And then also have their trauma dramaticized, that's a weird cycle to keep perpetuating, even if the element of revenge seems cathartic. I'm not sure it actually is.\\n\\nBut I can't say for sure until after Season 2 which will be released a couple of months from now.\",\n",

If this is not class, I don\\'t know what is.\\n\\nThis is modern Korean thriller at it\\'s best. If the story were to take place in US, the victim of school violence (or torture to be precise) would likely just grab an assault rifle from home (for self-defense purposes only of couse) and shoot dead her tormenters.

The show starts off really well and pace really well past the midpoint where it becomes really sloppy.\\n\\nWhile I completely understand the motive of the lead woman, she's extremely boring, stone-faced, one-dimensional, and not very enjoyable to watch. Surprisingly all of the best moments are moments showing other characters. The dullest moments are those with her and her depressing obsessed doctor follower.\\n\\nSeriously? Even as cringy, annoying, whiny, and obsessed so many people are in most Korean dramas are, Joo Yeo-Jung takes the cake.

There's always one playing on TV, and some of them are moderately interesting.\\n\\nThis one is by far the worst of any I've seen. If you put me in a coma, my acting would be equal to the main character. The female characters are catty, shallow psychopaths, and the male characters are complete simps, willing to do anything, and I mean anything, for a bland, soulless woman who is wholly uninterested in talking with anybody. The one older lady, who also stars in The Uncanny Counter (an action drama), is the only one that stands out as likeable and with acting skills.\\n\\nThe injustice part of the plot seems pretty unbelievable and gratuitous. The rest of the time, literally nothing happens. The main character just teaches a class, ghosts simps, and stands on her balcony eating a sandwich. How on Earth did they make a show out of this, for one, and how did anybody enjoy it? I gave it two stars because I was so disinterested in the story that I was able to use it for Korean listening practice without getting drawn in by the plot.\\n\\nSeason 2 opinion: Better than season 1, but still plenty of plot holes, strange editing choices, and confusing plot lines, I kept trying to figure out who was who, and why they were in the story. Some plot lines fizzle out unresolved, I would guess, because there were too many to keep track of.\\n\\nThat being said, a least things happen in this season, and in one episode, the main character had to do some acting, and she did fine. The character that played her mom, though...ugh. That was pretty rough.\\n\\nTo end on a good note, the cinematography team did a great job. I bumped it up from a 2/10 to 4/10 half because of them, and half because season 2 was an overall improvement.\",\n",

I am very hard to get positives from on this cos so many actors are bad but there were a few stand outs. If you exclude the main male role - the doctor, who could be replaced by a wooden puppet then the acting was good - excellent.\\n\\nThe quality overall was good. Well polished and felt modern. The writing though was not great. The characters were quite well developed but the story wasn't. It could have had some huge twists and turned in to this big ending but instead you just get trickle fed a revenge plot. As the synopsis reads very similar to that of Japanese film Confessions, where school teacher takes revenge, this was not even close to the scale of revenge satisfaction that film gave.\\n\\nI guess my overall feeling at the end was I'd rather have watched Confessions again and saved 14 hours of my life.\\n\\nTo sum up it was really good but a missed opportunity and needlessly long. 16 episodes is standard for K-Dramas, so they should be experts at pacing 16 episodes by now.\\n\\nPlease no more Shamans too. It totally detracts by being too weird.\",\n",
       " \"This Korean drama is centred on Moon Dong-eun, a woman who was appallingly bullied when she was at school. Now she is determined to have her revenge; especially against Park Yeon-jin, her chief tormentor. Dong-eun has been left with physical scars but she knows Yeon-jin is responsible for another girl's death. To aid her in her mission Dong-eun enlists the help of Kang Hyeon-nam, a victim of domestic violence.\\n\\nI found this to be a gripping, if somewhat gruelling drama. Thankfully the most disturbing events take place in the opening episode so if you can make it past these you should be okay. The characters are interesting; plenty are clearly villainous but the 'good' ones have a degree of moral ambiguity. There aren't too many laughs to be had but those that are come from Hyeon-nam as she attempts to get information on Dong-eun's targets. The cast does a really fine job making their characters believable even if occasionally the antagonists slip into pantomime villain territory.

It doesn't help that bullying victim Moon Dong-eun (Song Hye-kyo) has an alcoholic mother who is also easily bribed. The gang of bullies is led by Park Yeon-jin (Lim Ji-yeon) whose wealthy mother pays to cover her misdeeds even when she is responsible for the death of another student. The adult Dong-eun sets out to take revenge on the gang of bullies, confronting them, inserting herself into their lives. Naturally they fight back. A lot of psychological horror but there are some really disturbing scenes of violence. Shamanism also features with some impressive scenes of possession. A bit melodramatic at times, it could have been completed in less episodes but it is a convincing narrative with a good ensemble cast. Written by Kim Eun-sook and Directed by Ahn Gil-ho. Sixteen episodes on Netflix. 8/10.\",\n",
       " \"After watching the whole series, my impression is somewhat better than after the first eight episodes. Also, it is clear that although there are many inconsistencies in the story, especially in the police investigation, the whole plot should be seen primarily on a symbolic and metaphorical level. The relationships between the characters are well developed, and it is especially impressive to see how the characters themselves change as the story progresses and find themselves in new situations. This is especially true for Ha Do-Young.\\n\\nThe ending is a little melodramatic, but it fits well since the whole story is quite painful. Also, there is too much mixing of plot from different time periods which just makes it harder to follow.\\n\\nAll in all, a good series that is certainly not for those who want to watch something along the way for fun, but it is a good display of different characters with a special emphasis on evil people (that's the majority) who are irreparable until the end. No one had the slightest remorse for what they had done, but only felt sorry for themselves and looked to get out of their own problems regardless of who they hurt.\",\n",
       " \"Final update : it was just perfect. I loved from the beginning till end. Very nice story, very clever details, nice characterizations, nice scenes.\\n\\nI loved it so much! It is very very nice series. I haven't finished yet because it is long story but till 8 episode, it continues very well. After finishing I will update my review but I am sure I will be happy in the end. Story is good, characters are also good, sometimes when I watch, I confused about names but after that I can remember and I understand :) korean names are so difficult. Normally I hate flashbacks in a movie or series but in this story, well used. You can understand trauma behind of main character and it is really sad. Only one thing is annoying me about Korean series ; actors or actresses laugh so strange. It is so fake.. It is really good. Highly recommend to watch but you have to watch carefully because following the story can be difficult also there is a problem like lost in translation. Bravo Koreans, you know how to make a tension and in last years, thank you for producing very nice works in the sector.\",\n",
       " 'A revenge drama can be hard to watch. Especially if you allow the fact that revenge is a poor basis for justice to interfere with your going with the flow of the drama. This series largely avoids that problem through the nasties being agents of their own downfall. The victim seeking revenge does not kill or maim her targets. She manipulates them into doing that to each other.\\n\\nThat is possible because the nasties are such awful people. Of course anyone who bullies to the extent they bullied the victim at school is likely to grow up to be an awful nasty, so I had no issue with that. More problematic for me was that they would continue as \"friends\" into adult life despite being so horrible to each other. Their constant abuse of each other was fertile ground on which the victim could sow sufficient discord for their group to implode.\\n\\nI also felt that one or two of the revenge outcomes were a little too easy - for example the death of the abusive teacher required little effort from the victim.\\n\\nThe darkness of the storyline was partly redeemed by a love story - this is a kdrama after all! Gaining revenge did not give the victim her life back. She needed love to do that. If only she could have done it with the love but without the revenge.',\n",
       " \"The Glory begins with an unforgiving 1st episode. The cruel bullying by the elitist rich kids on the poor kid is gritty and gets you from the beginning. And ever since, I've been rooting for the victim to be successfu in her revenge schemes.\\n\\nThe pacing is good. There is a good balance between character building and plot advancement. You get to know all the characters while also getting exciting plot developments every episode. I binged through this series quite quickly. (Even at work)\\n\\nThroughout the revenge ploy, a romance sparks, which gives hint and hope at redemption for the protagonist victim... in a very K-drama way (guy would do anything for girl), which I think will appeal to a lot of female romantics.\\n\\nAnd I have to say that the Korean production is A-class... camera angles, editing, costume design, soundtrack... Korean entertainment production is high quality compared to other Asian entertainment industry standards.\",\n",
       " 'Great drama. Like we get so much emotionally connected that we tend to feel the pain and get that what the victim is suffering.\\n\\nIt is also a good love story which is so rreaall. Many of the reviews here are about first 8 episodes because they released first 8 at once and took almost more than a month to release the other 8, almost like another season but were released under the same.\\n\\nFirst 8 episodes went like it was just 1 episode.\\n\\nSo smooth and interesting series.\\n\\nStory is all about the revenge of botb the leads..but obviously only 2/16 for male, rest for the female.\\n\\nExecuted very well, was great and got it when I lost interest in kdramas because of their constant and dumb storylines of some series I have gone through before The Glory.\\n\\nGo for it.',\n",
       " \"The most clever, engaging, well written, acted, directed, designed, dressed, cast etc etc TV series that I have seen in a long time.\\n\\nIt truly grips you into binge watching it as each episode gets you thinking and wanting to know what the next step in Moon Dong-eons plan is going to be.\\n\\nSpeaking of Moon Dong-eon she is played to perfection by Song Hye-kyo; her performance was a massive part in being so hooked on the show. We found ourselves at many times aghast and cheering Dong-eon on as her well crafted plans play out.\\n\\nAnother stand out performance was that of Yeom Hye-ran as Kang Hyun-nam. Such a great comedy relief and a very heartfelt performance of the relationship with Dog-eon. I'd love to see a spin off comedy show with her as a private detective or something; blurred photos, baked eggs and kimchi included.\\n\\nI would highly recommend this show, it's just amazing. Roll on season 2!\",\n",
       " \"1. They all show ordinary characters, focusing only on strengthening the brutality of the villain. I'm just a bad guy!\\n\\n2. Song Hye-kyo seems to have passed the time to show her attractive appearance as the main character, and she cannot offset such shortcomings as an acting.\\n\\n3. The BGM used between scenes where the sequence is switched or the atmosphere is reversed is not natural.\\n\\n4. They seems to believe that emphasizing only cruelty brings sympathy or sympathy from viewers.\\n\\n5. The writer's reputation has a higher rating than expected, but it is certain to fall when objective evaluation begins to add.\\n\\n6. It is right for the artist to show her potential in the genre of romantic comedy, which is her strongest strength.\",\n",
       " \"Good drama. Solid and intriguing plot. It makes you root for the protagonists, hate the villains. A very well done basic and SHG's performance is breathtaking.\\n\\nThere are things that are very hard to swallow like: How the hell are girls abused, burned, in an open school gym? No help, no one says anything, this is very exaggerated. Even if bullying is VERY real, this part was pretty forced, because the damage to it was too visible to simply ignore.\\n\\nThe villains spend the entire series screaming at each other in ridiculous hysteria.\\n\\nThe end was sped up a bit in Dr. Joo Yeo-jung revenge. What a shame.\\n\\nFor me it's not fair to compare to Goblin or Eternal Monarch which are from the same director because those dramas have totally differents types of plot.\\n\\nI give Glory drama a 7/10.\",\n",
       " \"The story as such is great. A woman seeks revenge for the harm done to her in high school. Her plan is for the long term and requires patience and intelligence. The actor playing her role performs very well, as does her helper/friend and the old lady houekeeper that come into play. The scenario is also fine, even if it is more elaborate than needed.\\n\\nThe latter results in some pointless scenes that hardly add to the story. Add to that the vast amount of simple, awkward and plain ridiculous dialogues, the overacting in some of the roles (especially the bad guys and girls), the ridiculous self-talk, the aloud reading of text messages (why?), I understand that Korean people are more expressive in their emotions than we are in the west. The hysteria of some of the characters however is just too much to take most of the times. In this series it was just bearable. It is not hard to conclude that this intelligent and captivating story could have been told so much better.\\n\\nDespite all that however, there's enough in the story itself to keep you watching till the last episode. And ... the closer you get to the end, the better it gets with some really beautiful scenes. Not enough however for a 7+ rating.\",\n",
       " \"I love me some nasty people getting their comeuppance. Dong-eun is such a complex character. We get to follow her through her pain & finally get her revenge. I also loved Yeo-jeong & seeing how his fathers death truly made him a little psycho. For the rest...Yeon-jin has been one of those characters that irks me so much. I would see her on screen and I wanted to jump into the tv and give her one or two or three slaps. Jae-joon, Sa-ra, Hye-jeong, & Myeong-oh deserved all the bad they got. Karma named Dong-eun got them good. As for Do-yeong... I had meh thoughts about him. He was just some rich man nasty Yeon-Jin married, but I do love how he protected Ye-sol and took her away from everyone!! That little plot twist regarding Myeong-oh's death was also perfect... Over all a great drama, psycho thriller.\\n\\nPS.. Omg, how could I forget. Do-yeong's mom was the worst character not in the sense of bad writing, more in the sense that there really is mothers out there treating their kids this way. Hated her so much!! 🔪\",\n",
       " \"I'm a fan of Korean revenge dramas and movies. I rate Park Chan Wook's revenge trilogy movies very highly. I think this is just as good. Everything comes together so well to make a must see drama.\\n\\nThe acting is great. You end up disliking the baddies and end up invested in the main characters journey.\\n\\nThe story is well written and unfolds well. Each episode builds on the last. Will things work out the way we hope.\\n\\nThe production is first class. It looks great, and builds the world for the story to develop.\\n\\nI really can't think of anything bad in this drama. I'd recommend it to everybody. It's definitely worth watching.\",\n",
       " 'What a masterpiece of great work! Well done Correa!\\n\\nHats down for the great acting !\\n\\nI just finished now watching it and still crying after the sentence \" Wait for the spring to die\", but not just that thinking overall on the main character storyline it\\'s so sad and touching that it cannot get unnoticed.\\n\\nThe whole story was so greatly written and shown by all actors, which I must mention, the cast acting was superb.\\n\\nI will not exaggerate by admitting that it can be considered as one of the best in this genre.\\n\\nPsychological thriller and a very entertaining revenge game performed perfectly by the victim.\\n\\nAlso, I like that it did show the cultural differences, believes, social problems and the real troubles of a society.\\n\\nThe glory is a success and hopefully we will be able to see more of this on the platform.',\n",
       " 'What a beautiful story. This story takes you through the pain and rough world of Moon Dong-Eun, where she gets bullied by other kids, and almost by everyone in her surrounding. And as the story is about revenge, it ends with a beautiful journey from being weakest to being most strongest, and the surrounding which made her weak ends up with their own mess and sins they made throughout their life. It feels so good to see her smile in the end, with the life she missed while chasing to reach the destiny of being... what she deserved. Yes, this becomes emotionally heavy in the end as she steps closer to what she wants, it was sad but thankfully it has a happy ending. I liked her executioner, that cute love story which really means a lot as you care for them. I wished to see his dark side but he was saved by his angel from getting burned in his own hell.\\n\\nI also loved the opening sequence of the series, never skipped a single second of it every time. Especially \"The Whisper of Forest\" by SURAN. I will recommend this series if you ever wish to watch K-drama, then don\\'t miss this one.']"
